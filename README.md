TODO
**This is a WIP. Functionality is not complete, and error handling is not properly set**
Current features
- Searching overseerr and requesting from an item

# Known issues
- ~~Pagination is not implemented, will error out after 20 results.~~
- View code could be better

# TODO
- ~~add requests embed~~
- error handling
- add better logging on the api module (better-ish)
- Replace the view mess with pages and page groups (or something better)
